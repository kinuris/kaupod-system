# Fix for Admin Consultation Management - "Complete & Send Reminder" Button

## Issue
For admins in the consultation management page, when a partner doctor is selected and a consultation has 'Confirmed' status, there was confusion about the button to move to the next status.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was not that the button was missing, but rather that the button text "Send Reminder" was not clear enough to indicate that this was the final step in the consultation workflow.

## Solution Implemented
**File:** `resources/js/Pages/Admin/consultation-requests/index.tsx`

**Change:** Updated the button text from "Send Reminder" to "Complete & Send Reminder" to make it clearer that this action completes the consultation process.

### Before:
```tsx
Send Reminder
```

### After:
```tsx
Complete & Send Reminder
```

## Consultation Status Flow
The complete consultation workflow is:
1. **In Review** → Admin reviews consultation request
2. **Coordinating** → Admin coordinates with partner doctors 
3. **Confirmed** → Admin assigns partner doctor
4. **Reminder Sent** → Final status (consultation completed)

## Button Logic
The system correctly shows different UI elements based on consultation status:

- **'confirmed' status WITHOUT partner doctor**: Shows partner doctor selection dropdown
- **'confirmed' status WITH partner doctor**: Shows the "Complete & Send Reminder" button
- **Other statuses**: Shows general status dropdown

## Verification
✅ **Backend Logic**: ConsultationStatus enum correctly defines `Confirmed → ReminderSent` transition  
✅ **Frontend Logic**: Button correctly calls `updateStatus(request.id, 'reminder_sent')`  
✅ **UI Clarity**: Button text now clearly indicates final action  
✅ **Assets Built**: Frontend compiled with updated button text  

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Admin → Consultation Requests
2. Find a consultation with 'Confirmed' status and assigned partner doctor
3. Verify "Complete & Send Reminder" button is visible and clickable
4. Click button to move consultation to 'Reminder Sent' status
5. Confirm status transition works correctly

The consultation management workflow is now complete with clear button labeling for the final step.
